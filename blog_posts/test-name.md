# I redesigned this with AI

_This will be very raw and me talking to myself, I don't expect anyone to read this but me._

OpenCode is great. Their TUI works well, the new incoming desktop app is also amazing. Recommend.
Cursor still my editor, but I'm starting more and more to enjoy working with agents on the background to ship full fledged features.

## How to make it look different

You can go far with "Update my design COMPLETELY. Make it something Steve Jobs and Jony Ive would approve", not gonna lie, even with MiniMax M2.1 it did great, Opus 4.5 probably would be even better.

## Just do it

I just did an html file, edit mostly with AI, made some templates to render markdown which will be my posts. Almost like a CMS. Reminds me of a tweet from a cursor guy that they changed their CMS to be markdown files, will read that... good idea.

The barrier from idea from idea to implementation is getting very thin. Just try things, get a coding agent, put some credits and start prompting and seeing what happen, it is incredibly fun, and powerful! It's what I've been doing during my week of PTO. Starting to get used to these tools to make 2026 a great year.
