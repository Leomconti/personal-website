# Welcome

My personal blog, I write whatever comes to my mind. No structure, no AI generated content.

## What You'll Find Here

I probably won't even be posting but... you may find:

- **AI and Agents**: AI for coding, ideas, papers..
- **Things about my life**: Any random idea thoughts I have insights etc.
- **Startup AI work etc**: Some things about work AI agents, startup I'm working on.

## What I want to do

I really just want to push boundaries with AI, today, conversational AI, how to make it seem human, have incredible capabilities.

## Talk to me

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leomconti/) or [Twitter](https://x.com/mosmnc) if you'd like to discuss anything.

Thx, cya.
